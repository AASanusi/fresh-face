            <p>
                I've struggled for years with my oily skin and spent hundress on named brands but nothing has ever worked for me until I switched to fresh face remedies! Finally now starting to see the changes in my skin and also saving money too, seemed too good to be true but so glad I made the switch to natural!

                Created the most amazing facial scrub for dry skin following fresh face's latest remedy! Never felt my skin so hydrated before, my sister noticed the difference straight away so I made her a batch and gifted a few other to my friends - such a big hit! Thanks FF!

            <p>
                Had given up on my skin after discovering that its very sensitive and that the reason for my constant acne was the result of all the expensive products I had been buying thinking it would help. My girlfriend told me about Fresh Face thinking that the natural remedies would be better suited to my acne prone skin. Thank goodness, because I haven't looked back since!

            <p>
                Best site for DIY remedies! I'm a vegan and didn't realise how many brands test their products on animals, decided to start making my own and haven't looked back since! Great remedies for all skin types and the creating process was made super easy with the youtube tutorials.
